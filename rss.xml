            <description><![CDATA[<p>I struggle a lot with controlling my impulses. And I often
end up doing things that seem really stupid or unnecessary when I look back on
it. I buy stuff I donâ€™t need, eat tons of unhealthy food, waste hours browsing
news sites, YouTube, or other sites filled with brainless entertainment. And I
very often end up avoiding the things I had planned to do if I feel that they
are too hard. And I have been trying hard lately to understand why I behave this
way. I have even gone to see a shrink a few time, in order to find some logic
to what is going on in my head.</p>]]></description>
