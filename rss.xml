            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Types of interaction</h1><p>I usually spend more time with family during Christmas than
I normally do. And this Christmas I have been paying a bit more attention to
how spending time with various family members feel. And what I have noticed is
that when I feel like I can’t connect with the people I am with and all the
conversations starts to feel fake and repetitive and don’t have any other
purpose than keeping the conversation going. I start to get mentally tired. And
if I feel that I actively have to limit myself in order to avoid inappropriate
or uncomfortable situations, because one person doesn’t know certain things,
because one person dislikes another person’s or things like that, I actually
start to feel bad. </p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What does it mean to be human?</h1><p>In my current state of being, all I know is related to me
being a human. But what does it actually mean to be human? One of the challenges
when it comes to thinking outside the box, is to look beyond the limits that I
currently live under. And the biggest one of all is the fact that I’m human and
see the world through a human body.So
what is this body.</p></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Infinity – Do we have to know everything]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Infinity – Do we have to know everything</h1><p>Here’s the thing that kind of bothers me about most of the
new spiritual belief or what I would like to call the mainstream alternative
beliefs. They seem to both believe and not believe in infinity at the same
time. They claim that the core consciousness, the one consciousness, God or whatever
you would like to call it, is infinite but at the same time they claim that
there is a limit to how much we can experience within this infinite consciousness.
It seems, to me, that the people behind this new believes systems, that are
usually based a lot on older ones, can’t accept that there might be no end.
They can’t accept that existence is not about reaching some ultimate goal of
becoming one with the creator. </p></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Impulse and fear]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Impulse and fear</h1><p>I struggle a lot with controlling my impulses. And I often
end up doing things that seem really stupid or unnecessary when I look back on
it. I buy stuff I don’t need, eat tons of unhealthy food, waste hours browsing
news sites, YouTube, or other sites filled with brainless entertainment. And I
very often end up avoiding the things I had planned to do if I feel that they
are too hard. And I have been trying hard lately to understand why I behave this
way. I have even gone to see a shrink a few time, in order to find some logic
to what is going on in my head.</p></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Feeling Invisible]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Feeling Invisible</h1><p>Right now, it’s Christmas. And both yesterday and today I
spent time with various family. I have noticed or rather I realized one thing
that I have sort of realized before too. When I spend time with all these
people, I feel invisible. It feels like we all get together and talk about
“nothing”. And no one takes any kind of interest in the things I do. Whenever I
interact with anyone, be it with family or work colleagues, it’s never about
me. And it becomes very difficult to share when there is so little interest the
times I try to. It feels as if the more I try to interact with others, the more
invisible I become.</p></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Addiction]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Addiction</h1><p>I struggle with a few addictions. One has to do with the
fact that I can never do anything partly. So if I start, for example, to watch
something, I feel the need to watch and buy anything related to it. And that
can be a pretty big problem when I watch, read or play many things. And some of
these things are part of major franchises that includes content in all kinds of
mediums, that both costs a lot of money to get and takes a lot of time to just
find in the first place if it includes out of print products and such. The
truth is that it just isn’t fun at all. But jet I keep looking for new stuff to
collect. </p></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[What is money?]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What is money?</h1><p>What is money? We all use money, but we rarely actually
think about what money really is. The easiest way to realize what it is to start
by looking at a basic society without money. If you have a small group of
people living together in an isolated community. Then everyone helps each other
and everyone receives the things they need to survive.People help out not because they want to gain
something, but because they want to feel like a useful part of the group.</p></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Does A have to lead to B?]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Does A have to lead to B?</h1><p>We usually tend to do things in sequence or order. I do one
thing so therefore I do another thing. It’s a useful way of doing things when
it comes to improving our skills and abilities in life. I learn one thing then
another thing that builds upon the first thing and eventually learn to master
something very complicated and useful. But when we are faced with so many
things we can do, like we are in today’s world, this way of doing things can
also cause a lot of trouble for us. I watch a movie that I enjoy and therefore
I have to see all its sequels as well. I buy a book that I like and therefore I
need to buy all the books written by that author. </p></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Willpower]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Willpower</h1><p>What is willpower and how can I get better at using it? I
have been thinking a lot about these kinds of questions lately. One answer I
have reached, is that willpower is probably best defined as the ability to
resist my natural instincts. When I give into impulses for instance, it is
because my natural instincts tell me I should do it. What I mean by this is,
when I get an idea or some kind of urge, what often happens is that I go into a
kind of panic mode. My brain is telling me that this thing, whatever it is, is
so important that I just have to get it “now!”. So essentially I get so scared
of not giving into the impulse that I end up giving into it. What this means
then is that my lack of impulse control has to do with me having a lack of
courage.</p></article>]]></description>
