I struggle with a few addictions. One has to do with the
fact that I can never do anything partly. So if I start, for example, to watch
something, I feel the need to watch and buy anything related to it. And that
can be a pretty big problem when I watch, read or play many things. And some of
these things are part of major franchises that includes content in all kinds of
mediums, that both costs a lot of money to get and takes a lot of time to just
find in the first place if it includes out of print products and such. The
truth is that it just isn't fun at all. But jet I keep looking for new stuff to
collect. 

Whenever I decide not to keep or start collecting something.
I actually feel like a weight has been lifted of my shoulders. Because I don't
have to worry about it anymore. I have bought a lot lately. And I'm noticing
that it is making me tired, when I have to constantly keep track of packages
that I need to pick up at pickup points in various store et cetera. The truth
is, I get a small trill the moment I open the package. But everything else
around it from ordering, collecting to activating it afterwards, is boring and
takes a lot of time. This is why I'm trying to slow down. 

I would much rather just have something there for when I
feel like it rather than having to constantly look for things. The trouble I
guess is that I have this ability to picture myself doing just about anything.
And I need to get better at reminding myself that all things take time to do
that I either don't have or have to take from other activities. I need to
remind myself that it's much more fun to just enjoy the things I have and then
worry about new things if I ever run out. It's just painful to be in a state
where I constantly feel like I have to get something. And even though I might believe
it at times. Buying things doesn't really make it any better, it just makes resisting
the next thing even harder and more painful. And the only way out is to set
some clear boundaries when it comes to buying new stuff and stop looking for
new things I didn't even knew I needed before I found them. 

It's not about abandoning what I already have and the
activities I already are engaged in. It's about stopping to worry about missing
out on new things that I haven't even heard of. Right now I'm up-to-date on the
things I'm currently collecting. And if I just continue to collect these things
it should be easily manageable. And it should provide me with enough content to
keep me occupied for a long time. I don't need anything more. Because it will
only prevent me from experiencing all the things I already have. I am content
with what I have. And not having to worry about finding places to buy new
things or having to make sure that I have enough money in my account to pay for
all of it, is a huge relief. I need to just keep reminding myself of this. And
whenever I feel like there is something undefined I just have to do, which is
usually when I start to browse random pages on the net, I need to remind myself
that I already got all the things I need and that there is no good reason to
feel like this. 

I should also admit to myself that there does seem to be
some kind of underlying problem here. I'm clearly missing something in my life.
And I keep looking for it. And I keep finding things that aren't able to
satisfy that need. The question is whether it is because I never let myself
enjoy any of the things I find before I start looking for new things. Or
whether it is because I don't actually know or want to know what I'm looking
for and therefore keep finding the wrong things. But unless I try something I
will never figure it out. And hopefully with a bit of help from my shrink I
should be able to figure something out.

I DON'T WANT TO FEEL THIS PAIN ANYMORE! I WANT TO BE FREE OF
ALL THIS NEEDLESS WORRYING! I WANT TO ENJOY MY LIFE TO THE FULLEST WITHOUT
HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT MEANINGLESS THINGS! I WANT TO FEEL GOOD!
