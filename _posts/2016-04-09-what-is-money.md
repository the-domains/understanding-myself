What is money? We all use money, but we rarely actually
think about what money really is. The easiest way to realize what it is to start
by looking at a basic society without money. If you have a small group of
people living together in an isolated community. Then everyone helps each other
and everyone receives the things they need to survive.People help out not because they want to gain
something, but because they want to feel like a useful part of the group.

What seems to have happened at some point is that as communities
started to grow in size and complexity, the focus shifted from people working
to be a useful part of the whole group to people working to be useful for their
local group or family, or in some cases just for themselves. In the beginning,
what you see during this transition, is that people start to focus on a favor
for a favor. If you do this for me, I'll do that for you. But as the
populations keeps growing a system like this becomes less and less functional.
And so instead of exchanging favors directly people start to exchange pieces of
valuable materials as a symbol of the amount of work someone have done for them
or they have done for others. 

So in reality money is like a note saying that we have
worked a certain amount and have the right to receive something back that
requires an equal amount of work to do or make. And here lies the main problem
with how money works today. It's nowhere near equal in any way. Some people
work long hours and get only a small amount of money, while others hardly work
at all and make millions. And some inherit, win or are given huge amount of
money without having to do anything at all. In a small isolated community,
someone like that would be equal to someone who took advantage of all the
things, that the others in the group did or made, without helping out
themselves. Someone like that would be looked down upon and the behavior
probably wouldn't be tolerated by the group.

In our, huge global, society however, these kind of people
who either earn much more for the work they do than anyone else or in some
cases doesn't work at all, are often looked up to as successful people. And
there is something that just feels so wrong about that. Money have essentially
gone from being a tool used to exchange favors between people to becoming
something that the rich use to accumulate different forms of wealth that
requires many times more, the amount of manpower, than they themselves are able
to "produce". And much of the time the work that these people do, isn't even
useful to society. And of course when people try to point this out they are
either ignored or classified as activist or something similar.

They often try to defend their huge wealth by saying that
they have so much more responsibility or that the simply deserve it or some
other stupid excuse. And some people might argue that no one would want to be leaders
of big companies etc. if they didn't earn more doing it. But do we really want
the biggest companies around the world to be led by these kind of greedy people
who care so much for money that they are willing to take these jobs. The arguments
used to defend the wealth that the rich have, is just lies told to keep people
from rebelling against it, like people have done in the past.

In the past things used to be a bit different. In Europe for
instance we used to have systems of kings lords, lesser lords etc. And each of
these lords would force all the people living on "their land" into paying them
taxes that they could use to live "better" lives than all the "normal
people".Of course many of these lords
would provide some forms of minimal protection in exchange. But for the most
part, in the beginning, it was not about collecting money to provide services
for the people, like taxes is supposed to be today. It was about a group of
selfish people, who saw themselves as more important than the rest of us,
forcing people into indirectly working for them, for free.

People eventually grew tired of being used like this. And in
France this even lead to a revolution against the king and his allies. At this
point the wealthy probably realized that they had to change the way they
controlled things. So we started to get more and more democracies where the
people supposedly are in charge. But as the lords either disappeared or became
less powerful, what we started to see instead where powerful and wealthy
families who are in control of huge portions of the wealthiest companies in the
world. They sell all kinds of products and services that people either feel
that they need or actually do need. And because they pretty much own the
banking system, they have access to pretty much as much money as they want. 

Essentially we have gone from a system of kings and lords to
a system of democracies and wealthy companies. The democracies are there to
maintain the illusion that the societies we live in are fear while the big
companies are used by the powerful people behind the scenes to accumulate most
of the wheat being produced in the world. In fact, this sneaky way of doing
things seems to have worked out pretty well for them. They can collect even
larger portions of the wealth than they could under the previous system. And
most people don't realize what is going on and therefore don't complain about
it.

In short what money is today, is a corrupt tool used by the super-rich
and powerful to control and collect most of the wealth being produced by
"ordinary" people.
