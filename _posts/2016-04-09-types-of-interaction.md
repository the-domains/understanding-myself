I usually spend more time with family during Christmas than
I normally do. And this Christmas I have been paying a bit more attention to
how spending time with various family members feel. And what I have noticed is
that when I feel like I can't connect with the people I am with and all the
conversations starts to feel fake and repetitive and don't have any other
purpose than keeping the conversation going. I start to get mentally tired. And
if I feel that I actively have to limit myself in order to avoid inappropriate
or uncomfortable situations, because one person doesn't know certain things,
because one person dislikes another person's or things like that, I actually
start to feel bad. 

In fact, it's probably the main reason I tend to avoid
visiting my dad most of the time. I never feel like I can be myself around his
wife. And it makes me feel so uncomfortable that I don't really want to be
there. And because I am kind of afraid of being invited, though my dad is not
good at inviting people at all, I tend to avoid calling him because it means I
don't have to think about it. And since he is even worse than me when it comes
to staying in touch with family, we usually end up only seeing or speaking to
each other a few times each year, at most. This year I have only seen my dad
once, during Christmas. And I have only spoken to him once on the telephone, on
his birthday. It's not that I dislike my dad. We actually have a lot in common
when it comes to certain things, but I just don't feel like actively contacting
him when I know it can lead to uncomfortable situations.

The short explanation seems to be that fake or limited
interaction makes me tired. On the other hand, I feel almost energized when the
interaction has some kind of meaning. And I feel like I get something out of
it. Like when I talk about something that I'm interested in, when I take
Japanese lessons online or when I discuss something work related with a
colleague. 

The trouble is though that western culture is so full ways
to interact with people just for the sake of interacting. So much so, that
people can know each other for years and still know almost nothing about each
other. For many people, interaction seems to be just about trying to get along
with others. One person says and do what he thinks that the other person wants
him or her to say and do. And the other person does the same until they both
start to believe that it actually is the right thing to do and say, regardless
of what they believed in the first place. This is basically what culture is.
It's agreed upon ways of interacting that people use to please each other and
avoid misunderstandings. 

Obviously we need to have some kind of culture. If we didn't
it would be more or less impossible to interact. But the problem in today's
world, is that the culture part of human interaction, often, seems to take up
so much space in a relationship that there is hardly any space left for any
kind of "real" interaction where people actually get to know each other. In
fact, I will go as far as saying that there seem to be basically two kinds of
people. One type tries to fit in and tends to imitate others in order to fit
in. While the other type tries to be themselves and seeks more meaningful ways
of interacting with others.The second
kind of people are usually what I would like to see as "awake". Meaning that
they see through most of the illusions that are present in our cultures.

In fact, being "awake" and standing a bit on the outside of
the established cultures and sub cultures, can be a bit funny. I often notice
how some people seem to hide themselves in thick layers of odd styles and behaviors
that seem to hold no other meaning than fitting in to a certain group. They
might wear uncomfortable clothes, walk in weird ways, interact with each other
in aggressive or simple ways that make any kind of serious conversation
impossible. It's as if their entire life has just turned into some kind of role
they play. They are so afraid of not fitting in that they end up desperately
trying to be anything else than themselves. But the need to be us selves, is
there, regardless of whether we listen to it or not. And the more we avoid it
the worse things get.

My guess is that the stress epidemic we have been seeing for
some time now, is largely due to the fact that we live in a world where we feel
more and more surrounded by new forms of interaction, cellphones, email, social
media, etc. And people feel like they constantly have to show to the world how
"good" they are at fitting in or doing the things that people expect them to or
they think people expect them to do. And it has gotten to the point that more
and more people have little or no time to be themselves at all. And they feel
trapped in a way that leads to making them feel stressed.

Human society seems to have gone from being about living our
lives in a meaningful way to being about living our lives the "right" way. It's
not about living our lives any more it's about being successful and living a
life that others see as good. Life has turned into some kind of competition
that we can't win but still try to. I don't want to take part in this
competition. And have a hard time understanding those that see nothing else
than the competition. I hear about how they live their lives and notice how
similar it all seems. And I see how they seem enjoy talking to others about how
similar their lives are. It's almost as if the similarities make everything ok.
"My wife is bossy." "Oh my wife is bossy too ha ha". Neither the first or
second person likes that their wife is bossy but hearing that it's like that
for others as well makes it almost seem as a good thing because it means that
their life is similar to that of others. And if they are living similar lives,
it must mean that they are at least partly "normal". And after all being as
normal as possible or being as similar as possible to the people you interact
with on a daily basis, seems to be one of the main things they need to achieve
in order to win the competition.

Many people are so afraid of not doing the right things that
they end up with groups of people who only do to each other what they think the
others want them to do while in reality not any one of them do anything that
they actually want to do. Or there might be one person in the group who
understands it and uses it to manipulate all the others in the group to do the
things he or she wants them to do.

This is also the principle governments, big companies, big
organization and secret societies use to manipulate people all over the world. Most
people are just waiting for someone to tell them what is the right thing to do
or think. And by using mass media, famous people and world leaders to tell us
what that is, they are able to manipulate most of the world population into
behaving and thinking in the way they want them to. The reason our world has
become so fake and stressful is because that is the way they want it to be. The
more occupied we are with trying to live or lives the "the right way", the less
time we have to actually stop to think and realize what is actually going on.

Being on the outside like this is kind of like opening
Pandora's box. Once you see how fake it all is. There is no way of returning to
that way of living.And it can make
dealing with does who are still "asleep" difficult. I seem to be surrounded by
people who are asleep. And it makes me tired and sometimes a bit stressed.
Which is why I, often, tend to avoid interacting with others if I can.
