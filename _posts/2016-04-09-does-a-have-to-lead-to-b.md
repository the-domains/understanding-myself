We usually tend to do things in sequence or order. I do one
thing so therefore I do another thing. It's a useful way of doing things when
it comes to improving our skills and abilities in life. I learn one thing then
another thing that builds upon the first thing and eventually learn to master
something very complicated and useful. But when we are faced with so many
things we can do, like we are in today's world, this way of doing things can
also cause a lot of trouble for us. I watch a movie that I enjoy and therefore
I have to see all its sequels as well. I buy a book that I like and therefore I
need to buy all the books written by that author. 

The problem I have, at least, and probably many others to,
is that if I find something that I enjoy, I can't stand the thought of not
experiencing everything related to it. Sometimes it can even be something as
general as a genre of entertainment. And so I end up hording stuff that I plan
to experience in the future. But the "pile" often ends up growing and growing
because I can't keep up with all the things I plan to experience. This is a
case where one thing leading to another just doesn't work in real life, no
matter how much I might want it to.

In essence this is a matter of letting go and accepting that
I can't really miss something I haven't experienced jet. Just because I enjoy
an experience, doesn't need to mean anything more than that. Yes, I enjoyed and
now I can move on and find something else to enjoy. This is easier said than
done. To me the pull to get everything is often very strong and it can be very
hard to say no to myself. It feels kind of like I have lost something very
important that I need to get back. And I enter a kind of panic mode where my
only focus is to "get it back".When I'm
like this, I don't think about whether the thinsg I do or plan to do are good
ideas or not. I simply "know" that I just have to do it. 

It's like I fall in to a mode where I start to feed myself all
kinds of lies in order to make myself do whatever I feel like at the moment.
And the clue to stopping this is to get used to spotting the lies and stopping
myself from believing them before things go too far and I end up for example
making some kind of impulse buy. And one of the major lies I have to deal with
is the "A have to lead to B" kind of lie. I have gone so far, so I might as
well go a little further. I have bought that one so I have to buy that one to.
I enjoyed that game, so I need to buy all other games similar to it, because
they are probably good to. I'm used to doing this so I should probably keep
doing it.

I need to start focusing on enjoying the things I
do and stop worrying about other potentially good things I'm missing. As long
as I'm enjoying the things I do end up doing, there is no reason to become
upset about not experiencing other things that I don't have time for. There is
always something enjoyable out there if I look for it and therefore there is no
reason to look for more before I actual have time for something. And regardless
of what I choose to do, experiencing one thing will always mean that I'm not
experiencing something else. I think I need to shift my focus from focusing on
what I don't have to focusing on what I do have. My life would be so easier and
also less stressful if I didn't need to worry about all the things I'm
potentially missing all the time.
