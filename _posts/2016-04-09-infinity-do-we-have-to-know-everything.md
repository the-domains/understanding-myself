Here's the thing that kind of bothers me about most of the
new spiritual belief or what I would like to call the mainstream alternative
beliefs. They seem to both believe and not believe in infinity at the same
time. They claim that the core consciousness, the one consciousness, God or whatever
you would like to call it, is infinite but at the same time they claim that
there is a limit to how much we can experience within this infinite consciousness.
It seems, to me, that the people behind this new believes systems, that are
usually based a lot on older ones, can't accept that there might be no end.
They can't accept that existence is not about reaching some ultimate goal of
becoming one with the creator. 

My belief when it comes to consciousness, is that it is, in
a sense, an awareness of nothingness. There is nothing else than consciousness.
But by becoming aware of this lack of any other form of existence, we become
aware of the two basic states of all creation. The state of being and the state
of not being, or what we in the digital world would refer to as 1 and 0\. And
creation of thought that eventually leads to the creation of separate thoughts,
like our own local consciousness, is all created out of the contrast that exist
between the state of being and the state of not being. And the amount of
possibilities that exist within that contrast is infinite. 

A thought can turn into a separate thought entity, that
entity can turn into a whole universe and start making new thought entities of
its own, like soles for instance, and these entities can evolve to the point
where they themselves create new universes on their own while the universe they
evolved in evolves to something even bigger. Each new universe is something
completely different, because it builds on the individual experiences of the
individual entities within the specific universe they evolved in. And there are
also bound to be other forms of thought entities and other forms of reality
that doesn't exist within a universe or exist in any way we can imagine. A
universe, is just one thought concept among many other thought concepts that
exists within infinite consciousness. 

The way I see it, consciousness is like a forever growing
tree, where new and unique branches constantly grow out of older ones. As a
branch gets older and older, it will start to see an increasingly bigger and
bigger picture. But the goal is not to see the same as the creator. We are
already a part of the creator. And the creator already sees everything. The
goal is just to become more, to experience more and most importantly, to
understand more about our self from our own unique perspective, that we get
from our own unique never ending journey.

To many people this way of looking on things, seems to
translate into existence being meaningless and without a purpose. And so they
reject it in favor of, seemingly, simpler concepts where all they have to is
follow some kind of established system and do the "right" things in order to
"level up". I have listened to enough of this crazies by now to realize that
most of what they say about levels, dimension, aliens, karma and all kinds of
other crazy stuff, is mostly made up by people who make stuff up based on each
other's lies. And just like no one speaks up and say that the emperor is naked
in the story about "The Emperor's New Clothes", no one speaks up about the fact
that they are all lying. "If enough people say it, it must be true. And if I
want to become a part of this community I need to make lies that match what the
others are saying."

I'm not saying that it's all lies. Among all the complicated
stories and "leveling systems", there are some basic truths. But I think the
basic problem has to do whit what goal they are trying to reach and what we are
actually trying to reach. Their goal is to understand everything that already
is and become one with the creator. While our real goal is to expand what
already is and become more of ourselves in our own unique way.

I realize that when I speak of uniqueness that it can seem a
bit selfish compared to the "mainstream" concept of oneness. But there isn't
really that much of a difference. We are not alone in this reality. And as we
continue to grow, we will continue to share our experiences with all the entities
that exist within the thought entity that created us. And as we grow we will
become closer and more connected. And many of the "creations" we make may just
as likely be something we make together as opposed to something we make alone.
In fact, I would guess it's probably more likely. But we will continue to exist
as a unique thought entity and when new thought entities are created in the
realities that we create either alone or together, they will all have to stem
from one single thought entity. Just like the characters we create and acts as
within our own fantasies can only stem from our own mind.

Whit in the fantasy comparison lies an important point for
afterthought though. When we create fantasies, we usually let go of them after
a while and they disappear.Our
phantasies are non-persistent unlike our "real lives" that seems to go on no
matter what. The way I see it, we are all like phantasies within the one mind.
And when I'm thinking, it's not me, the human, that is thinking. It's the one
mind talking from the perspective of being me. We are all the one mind. The
feeling we have of self, is not really the feeling of being a specific human,
it's the feeling of being the one. And just like there is no point in mourning
the loss of a phantasy, because the characters within it was just me thinking
from another point of view. There is no point in being afraid of losing our
current self, because it's only the creator thinking from the perspective of
being us.

What I'm trying to say is that there exists a possibility
that some branches reach a point where they stop growing. In fact, our
phantasies pretty much prove that. And we can't be sure whether we are a branch
that will keep growing after human death, or whether it will end at that point
as just an experience had by a "higher" entity. The concept of souls and reincarnation, sort
of deals a bit with this. But the main view seems to be that we reunite, sort
of, with the soul when we die. But the way I see it the most likely explanation
is, that the soul is playing the role of multiple characters within this
reality, one after each other. And just like we only bring part of ourselves
into a phantasy, the same is true for the soul. Whatever memories people have
of past life and other things that exist beyond, are there because the soul
choses to bring those memories into the "phantasy". When we dye the phantasy
ends and we, as humans, go from being an active character within a phantasy to
being a collection of memories among other similar memories within the memories
of the soul. 

Both we and our soul, seems to be bound by a limitation when
it comes to focused thought. We can only keep one line of thought going at
once. But if I assume that I'm not alone, then other, "higher entities", should
exist that are capable of keeping more lines of thought going at once. Or there
is another possibility. When we create phantasies, we can be all the characters
within it. And we simply switch between them to keep "the story" going. The one
mind could simply be doing the same. If we assume that time is just an illusion
that exist within the human mind. Then it's possible that the one mind is just
shifting endlessly between perspectives outside of time. So that there is never
more than one perspective at any given time. And the one mind can "play" and
mix up all it's different perspectives in any way it wants, just like we can
with our phantasies. What I mean by no time is that everything can happen both separately
and together at the same time. So the one consciousness is having the
experience of being both separate beings and the whole at the same time.
Without time, there is no way of separating one thing from another and so they
all seem to be happening at the same time.

Looking at it like this actually makes the whole concept of
levels and thought entities existing only within the thought entity it was
created, seem meaningless. I can have a phantasy that I let go of. But the one
mind can find it interesting and decide to keep it going separate of my mind.
In fact, if the one mind can just keep an infinite amount of realities going
like this. It's likely that no line of thought is ever given up on.
