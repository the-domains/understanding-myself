What is willpower and how can I get better at using it? I
have been thinking a lot about these kinds of questions lately. One answer I
have reached, is that willpower is probably best defined as the ability to
resist my natural instincts. When I give into impulses for instance, it is
because my natural instincts tell me I should do it. What I mean by this is,
when I get an idea or some kind of urge, what often happens is that I go into a
kind of panic mode. My brain is telling me that this thing, whatever it is, is
so important that I just have to get it "now!". So essentially I get so scared
of not giving into the impulse that I end up giving into it. What this means
then is that my lack of impulse control has to do with me having a lack of
courage.

Seeing it this way, I realize that the way to improve my
impulse control is not by trying harder or by trying to make things easier. The
way to do it is by learning to recognize when I start to panic and then
reassure myself that there is nothing to be afraid off. I also have to realize
that when something is hard the only way to make it easier is to keep on doing
it. Because if I expect things to be easy all the time I will constantly end up
panicking each time something becomes a bit difficult. And most of the times
the things I find hard, aren't really hard at all. It's just a false belief or
a kind of phobia that makes certain activities seem hard before I start doing
them. And when I panic it's a kind of automatic response similar to that of
someone who freaks out at the sight of a tiny spider. 

I think of something I should or want to do. And I suddenly
panic over the fact that I haven't done it already. And I end up doing it as
soon as possible, before I have had the time to think about wetter or not it is
a good idea. I'm just so scared of not following up on "good ideas" about
things to do and missing opportunities to "pleasure" myself, with food,
entertainment, etc. that I panic whenever I fear not getting the things I'm
thinking about. It's an irrational fear, because I haven't got the time or
money to do all these things that I think about.

I need to learn to see the difference between fear and
truth. And learn to overcome my fear of not being able to have and do
everything. If I can get more used to that. Then I can stop feeling so awful
every time I decide not to do something. And I can stop myself from doing
things instinctively without thinking first.
