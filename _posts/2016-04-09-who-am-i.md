I thought I would start this blog by writing a bit about
myself and why I decided to start this blog. 

I'm what you could probably describe as a loner. Beyond
colleagues at work and a few family members, I don't actually have any friends.
I love to think and explore new ideas. But the people I interact with on a
daily basis usually aren't interested in anything more than what is on the
surface, day to day life and things like that. And when I have tried to show
more of myself or get closer to people in the past I feel that I have gotten
rejected in a way. And I feel a sense of frustration over not being able to
share more about myself with other likeminded people. 

So I wanted to start this blog, in order to create a space
where I can feel free to write about myself and my ideas. And hopefully some of
the things I write can be helpful or inspirational for others to read as well. I
have written a few blogs in the past. And I have also done some personal
writing previously. So I am fairly used to writing. But I wanted to create
something a bit different this time. I have a tendency of writing in a very
un-personal way. And I often write as if I'm more of an expert than I actually are
on certain subjects. My goal therefore with this blog is to write about
subjects from a more personal perspectives and use examples that are more
relevant to my own life. And actually admitting that I am a loner from the
start, is a part of that.

It's important to mention this. Because it's a big part of
who I am. I spend a lot of time alone. And much of that time is spent thinking
about all kinds of things like life and death, consciousness, politics,
conspiracies, potential futures and much more. Trying to understand everything
is a huge part of who I have become. And I wouldn't have had the time to become
that person if I hadn't spent so much time alone. My guess is that a lot of
great thinkers tend to be loners to some extent. Because if we spend all our
time with other people, we tend to get so caught up in a kind of group
mentality, that it is harder to find time and space for our own thoughts. So
though I wish that I could perhaps have a few friends, I wouldn't want to
change my past because it has made it possible for me to understand the world
in a way I probably wouldn't have been able to if I had lived a more "normal"
life.

And of course I have other interests as well. I
read books, play video games, watch drama and anime, and I spend an insane amount
of time learning Japanese. I love to do and try all kinds of new things.
Actually I love it a bit too much and sometimes find it a bit hard to control
my impulses. So I'm not exactly perfect, but I'm working hard to change myself
and become a better version of myself. And some of that I might write about in
this blog, from time to time. Basically this is going to be a blog about me, my
thoughts, ideas and interest. And unlike previous blogs, I'm not going to limit
myself in any way in order to try to stay within some kind of norm or genre.
