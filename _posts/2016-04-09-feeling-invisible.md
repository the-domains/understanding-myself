Right now, it's Christmas. And both yesterday and today I
spent time with various family. I have noticed or rather I realized one thing
that I have sort of realized before too. When I spend time with all these
people, I feel invisible. It feels like we all get together and talk about
"nothing". And no one takes any kind of interest in the things I do. Whenever I
interact with anyone, be it with family or work colleagues, it's never about
me. And it becomes very difficult to share when there is so little interest the
times I try to. It feels as if the more I try to interact with others, the more
invisible I become.

This is the main reason why I shy away from social
situation, is because it feels like I get trapped in a world where I'm not
allowed to be me. It feels like a kind of artificial world where everyone is
doing their best to mimic each other to fit in. I don't want to mimic others in
order to fit in. I want to be me. And I want to be with people who are
interested in me, not just interested in being nice to me. I don't want pity I
want real connections.

I feel as if I have had it like this most of my life. I live
in a kind of world of my own that I have no one to share with. And because I
can't find anyone interested in sharing that world with me I remain alone
regardless of whether I interact with people or not. 

I feel insignificant and it sometimes lead me to pursue
addictive habits in order to feel more significant. Being good at an online
game ore mastering new and difficult things can make me feel more significant.
But regardless of all the effort I make to hide it. I do get depressed some
time. And I try to hide be doing things that make me feel good like buying
unhealthy food, buying things on the net or watching porn.

I hate to admit that I'm lonely. And I hate to admit I'm
depressed. Because it forces me to admit that I have a problem that I have to
do something about. Which means I have to change in some way in order to get
rid of the problem. And I'm afraid of changes because I don't want to stop
being the one I am.
