In my current state of being, all I know is related to me
being a human. But what does it actually mean to be human? One of the challenges
when it comes to thinking outside the box, is to look beyond the limits that I
currently live under. And the biggest one of all is the fact that I'm human and
see the world through a human body.So
what is this body.

A body, the way I see it, is essentially an encoding machine
that reads and encodes the information that surrounds us and turns it into an
objective world that we can then relate to. And so how much we can see and
understand, is determined by how much our bodies are able to pick up through
our senses and how that information is presented to us. 

Trough science, we already know for a fact that there is a
lot that our bodies are incapable of sensing. We only see light within certain
wavelengths, we only hear sound within certain frequencies and so on. They are
invisible to us, but are still so similar to what we are able to sense. And
they are so closely related to the objective world we live in that we are able
to create tools from what we are able to see in order to find these things that
we don't see.

My guess however, is that not all things beyond our senses is
that easy to pick up. The basic reason we have been able to find invisible
light and so on, is that these things interact with the things that we do see.
But what if there is no interaction, how then can we these hidden things. The
answer is of course, that we can't. The way we experience reality is in many
ways like using an operating system to explore the contents of a hard drive.
There may be hidden files and so forth on de drive. And we may have to alter
and manipulate how the operating system works in order to see these files. But
ultimately there is one obstacle we can't get past. Not all information that
exist, is contained on that disk. Even if we take into account all the
information that is available to us on the internet, there is still much more
that simply isn't there. 

To put this in terms related to our reality, we are only
able to see what's contained within the reality. And any outside elements, that
may or may not have an effect on our reality remains invisible to us. We are
constantly trying to explain how everything works, but fail to see that it's
actually impossible to do this from within this reality. In fact it's
impossible in any reality. To give another example. If we create a computer AI
within a 2d environment, how can we expect that AI to understand a 3d environment.
Or to give a more human example. If a person that can't hear is never thought
that sound exists how can he know about it. 

We live inside a kind of closed environment, where all we
can ever hope to see are the things contained within this environment.
Existence is essentially an endless amount of realities that exist within each
other. And generally speaking, we can say that we are always, whether we are aware
of it or not, interacting with three of those realities. The first of these
realities are the reality from which we observe. Just like we are not inside
the computer that we use, we are not actually inside the reality we are
experiencing. The observer is then another kind of entity that observes the
reality we are in from the reality that ours exist within. The second reality,
is of course the one we usually think of as reality, namely the objective
reality around us. And the third reality, is our internal reality. It is our
personal interpretation of the outside reality, our thoughts and our
phantasies. 

Using this three-part reality system, I can also explain how
one reality springs out of another. Using thoughts, we can create phantasy
world in our heads. We can imagine independent entities and the world that they
live in. We are not able to sustain these phantasies as humans. But ours soul
however are capable of this. Meaning that what we see as reality is essentially
a phantasy that is sustained for a very long time. Unlike our phantasies
though. I don't think that this phantasy is one our soles has alone. Just like
thought characters in our heads can interact with each other and create new
phantasies together, so can souls created from the same thought entity above
it, work together to create collective phantasies. 

So what we live in is a sustained collective phantasy. In
fact, all of existence is just on endlessly huge collection of phantasies
within phantasies.Some are virtually
endless, some, like ours, are very short, and some lasts for a while and then
end. Our human lives belong to the last part. Our souls are not jet capable of
sustaining phantasies indefinitely. So when we die, the entities that we see as
ourselves ceases to exist as an independent thought entity and becomes part of
the soul. In fact, we have always been a part of the soul. I mean when we
imagine a character in our head, we are essentially playing a role as someone
else in our heads. It's not an independent entity, it's just a different
version of ourselves. The same is true for the relationship between us and our souls.
The soul is us. We are roles that the soul is playing within this reality
framework. When we die and the soul leaves the role behind, nothing more is
lost than when an actor takes of his costume after haven finished playing a
role. This is just the way reality works. And ultimately we are all just the
same consciousness disguised as different entities in order to be able to interact
with ourselves.
